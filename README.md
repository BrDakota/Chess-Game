# Chess-Game
 This is a simple chess game created in Unity

 In the current state of the game you can play an entire game of chess after moving past the starting screen. The game includes all chess rules (with the exception of en passant due to me forgetting).
 The intentions of the game were to be a simple home for me to test a chess bot running on a neural network that I wanted to build. I still plan to do this but want to move on to the other projects at the moment. The game can also be used to practice different chess openings and principal. It is also good for setting up quick board states.
 If anyone makes a good chess bot or uses a neural network for their chess bot feel free to reach out to me and send it over. I would love to look at it and learn about it to get some ideas for the future.

 

The game opens with a land screen where you can press play. After pressing play the user will be white pieces and the game will begin.

After the game begins the user will be playing both sides. White will move first and the pieces will alternate turns.

Once one of the kings has been captured the user will have the option to play again. If the player selects play again the game will reset the scene and allow another game.
