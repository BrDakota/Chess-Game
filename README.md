# Chess-Game
 This is a simple chess game created in Unity

 In the current state of the game you can play an entire game of chess after moving past the starting screen. The game includes all chess rules (with the exception of en passant due to me forgetting).
 The intentions of the game were to be a simple home for me to test a chess bot running on a neural network that I wanted to build. I still plan to do this but want to move on to the other projects at the moment.
 If anyone makes a good chess bot or uses a neural network for their chess bot feel free to reach out to me and send it over. I would love to look at it and learn about it to get some ideas for the future.
